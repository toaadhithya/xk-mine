# `xk` Whitepapers

This folder is intended to store documentation which aims to explain selected `xk` topics in a whitepaper fashion. Documentation grouped here is potentially more in-depth than necessary for students looking to just complete the labs, but is hopefully at least interesting for students looking to dig deeper into the discussed topics.
