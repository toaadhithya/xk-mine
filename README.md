# CSE 451 Operating Systems Labs

## Intro

Welcome! Contained in this repo are specs and starter files necessary for completing the CSE 451 labs. Lab specs are contained in the `lab/` folder, e.g.: lab1's spec will be in `lab/lab1.md`.

## File layout

Documentation related to developing `xk` is located under `docs/`, although the best way to start out with the repo is to just start with the specs and follow them (they will link to relevant documentation and files within the repo as they go along).
